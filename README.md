## Scrum

![Scrum process](images/scrum-process.jpg "Scrum process")

### Definition

- Is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
- Basically requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
	+ A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog
	+ The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint
	+ The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint
	+ Repeat

### The Scrum Team

- Consists of:
	+ 1 Scrum Master
	+ 1 Product Owner
	+ Developers
- No sub-teams
- No hierarchies
- Typically 10 or fewer people
- If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams:
	+ Each focused on the same product
	+ They should share:
	  * The same Product Goal
		* Product Backlog
		* Product Owner
- Is responsible for all product-related activities:
	+ Stakeholder collaboration
  + Verification
  + Maintenance
  + Operation
  + Experimentation
  + Research and development
  + Anything else that might be required

#### Three accountabilities:

+ **The Developers:** are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint
	* Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
	* Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
	* Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal
	* Holding each other accountable as professionals
+ **the Product Owner**
	* Is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team
	* Is accountable for effective Product Backlog management
		- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
		- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items
		- Ordering Product Backlog items
		- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood
	* The Product Owner is one person, not a committee
		- May represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog
		- Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner
 
+ **The Scrum Master**
	* Is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide
	* Help everyone understand Scrum theory and practice
	* Is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness
	* Serves the Scrum Team in:
		- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
		- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
		- Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress
		- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox
	* Serves the Prduct Owner in:
		- Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
		- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
		- Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
		- Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed

### Scrum Events

- The Sprint is a container for all other events
- Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts
- These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required
- Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity

#### Sprint

- Fixed length events of one month or less
- A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous
- During a sprint
	+ No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
	+ Quality does not decrease
	+ The Product Backlog is refined as needed
	+ Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned
- A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
- Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.
- What happens within a Sprint:

	##### Sprint Planning

	+ Initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint
	+ Timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter
	+ Addresses the following topics
		* Why is this Sprint valuable?
			- The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders
			- The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning
		* What can be Done this Sprint?
			- The Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint
			- The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process
		* How will the chosen work get done?
			- For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done
			- Often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less (US)

	##### Daily Scrums

	+ Purpose:
		* Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal
  	* Adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary
  	* Adjust the upcoming planned work
	+ Is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team
	+ Held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint
	+ If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers
	+ Focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal
	+ Produces an actionable plan for the next day of work
	+ The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work

	##### Sprint Review

	+ Inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations
	+ The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders
	+ Progress toward the Product Goal is discussed
	+ The Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment
		* Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next
		* The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation
	+ Is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours

	##### Sprint Retrospective

	+ The purpose is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness
	+ The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done
	+ The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved
	+ Timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a onemonth Sprint

### Scrum Artifacts

#### Product Backlog

+ Is an ordered list of what is needed to improve the product
+ It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team
+ Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event
+ Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items
+ The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing

#### Product Goal

+ Describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against
+ The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog
+ Is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next

#### Sprint Backlog

+ Is composed of
	* The Sprint Goal (why)
	* The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what)
	* An actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)
+ Is a plan by and for the Developers
+ Highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal
+ Is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned

#### Sprint Goal

+ Is the single objective for the Sprint
+ Is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog
+ As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind
+ If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal

#### Increment

+ Is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal
+ Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments, ensuring that all Increments work together
+ In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable
+ Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint
+ The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism
+ An Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint
+ The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value
+ Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done

#### Definition of Done

+ Is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product
+ The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born
+ If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration
+ If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum
+ If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product
+ If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done

## Microservices
- Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together
- One should use microservices as a means to obtain a desired outcome rather than for the sake of using a new technology
- Microservices shouldn't be the default option. If you think a service architecture could help, try it with one of the modules from a very simple monolith typology and let it evolve from there

### Kubernetes

#### What is Kubernetes?

- What if you could just define "This process should have 6 copies using X amount of resources." and have the *2..N* computers working as a single entity to fulfill your request? That's just one thing Kubernetes makes possible
- In essence, Kubernetes is the sum of all the bash scripts and best practices that most system administrators would cobble together over time, presented as a single system behind a declarative set of APIs
- Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery
- The main responsibility of an orchestration system:
	+ Starting and stopping of containers
 	+ Networking between containers
 	+ Health monitoring
 	+ We want the system to keep the application automatically healthy

#### Kubernetes cluster with k3d

- A cluster is a group of machines, nodes, that work together
- "Server nodes" are nodes with control-plane
- "Agent nodes" are nodes without that role

- A cluster with k3d:

#### kubectl

- The Kubernetes command-line tool
- Allows to interact with the cluster
- Read kubeconfig and use the information to connect to the cluster
- The contents include certificates, passwords and the address in which the cluster API

#### Terminology

- Pod
	+ An abstraction around one or more containers
	+ Container of containers
- ReplicaSets
  	+ Used to tell how many replicas of a Pod you want
	+ It will delete or create Pods until the number of Pods you wanted are running
	+ ReplicaSets are managed by Deployments
- Deployment
  	+ Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets
  	+ You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate
  	+ A Deployment resource takes care of deployment. It's a way to tell Kubernetes what container you want, how they should be running and how many of them should be running
  	+ Kubernetes take care of rolling out a new version of a deployment by using tags (e.g. hehe/image:tag), with the deployments each time we update the image we can modify and apply the new deployment yaml
- Service
  	+ Service resource will take care of serving the application to connections from outside of the cluster
  	+ Used to expose and access applications running within a Kubernetes cluster
  	+ Enable network communication between different parts of your application or between different applications
  	+ They provide a consistent and stable endpoint to interact with your application, regardless of how many pods or replicas are running, their IP addresses, or their current state
  	+ Types:
  		* ClusterIP
  	 		- Internal service (only accessible within the cluster)
  	   		- Useful for inter-pod communication
		* NodePort
			- Exposes the service on a static port on each node
  			- Used for external access to a service
  	  		- Not flexible and require you to assign a different port for every application
  	    	- Are not used in production but are helpful to know about
  	     	- Service.yaml :

					apiVersion: v1
					kind: Service
					metadata:
					  name: my-nodeport-service
					spec:
					  type: NodePort
					  selector:
						app: my-app # This is the app as declared in the deployment.
					  ports:
						- name: http
						  nodePort: 30080 # This is the port that is available outside. Value for nodePort can be between 30000-32767
						  protocol: TCP
						  port: 1234 # This is a port that is available to the cluster, in this case it can be ~ anything
						  targetPort: 3000 # This is the target port

		* LoadBalancer:
			- Creates an external load balancer
			- Useful in cloud environments where load balancers can be provisioned automatically
		* ExternalName:
			- Maps a service to a DNS name
			- Acts as CNAME record

  #### Best practices
  
- When updating anything in Kubernetes the usage of delete is actually an anti-pattern and you should use it only as the last option. As long as you don't delete the resource Kubernetes will do a rolling update, ensuring minimum (or none) downtime for the application. On the topic of anti-patterns: you should also always avoid doing anything imperatively! If your files don't tell Kubernetes and your team what the state should be and instead you run commands that edit the state you are just lowering the bus factor for your cluster and application.
- Often you (the maintainer or developer) don't have to do anything in case something goes wrong with a pod or a container. Sometimes you need to interfere, or you might have problems with your own configuration.
- Debugging tools:
  + kubectl describe
  + kubectl logs
  + kubectl delete
